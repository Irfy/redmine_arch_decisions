OVERVIEW

The purpose of the Arch Decision plugin for Redmine is to allow teams to collaborate on project decisions (primarily technical ones), 
to encourage explicit statements of assumptions and prioritizations, and to provide tracking after the decision has been made so that
teams can have a collective memory as to how decisions were made in the past.

CURRENT FEATURES

* List Arch Decisions (currently only manually, via the /arch_decisions URL)
* List Factors (currently only manually, via the /factors URL)
* CRUD Arch Decisions (with only basic info)
* CRUD Factors (with only basic info)
* Associate Factors with ADs, and remove associations

ROADMAP

* Add menu options to access the plugin pages
* Associate Factors and ADs with projects (currently, not sure whether or not their scope should be limited to projects, since they often will be useful to more than one)
* Add statuses to Factors and ADs for a basic workflow (including an investigative phase, a resolution phase, implementation and deprecation)
* Add a discussion forum to both ADs and Factors
* Allow configuration of notifications for these discussions and status change events
* Allow associations between ADs and Issues
* Allow tagging of ADs and Factors for easy and flexible categorization and search
