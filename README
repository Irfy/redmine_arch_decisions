OVERVIEW

The purpose of the Arch Decision plugin for Redmine is to allow teams to collaborate on project decisions (primarily technical ones), 
to encourage explicit statements of assumptions and prioritizations, and to provide tracking after the decision has been made so that
teams can have a collective memory as to how decisions were made in the past.

VERSION: 0.0.7 dev build

RELEASE NOTES

* Feature #582 - Enable security controls on the Arch Decisions features - Basic permissions are now required in order to perform actions other than view the entries
* Feature #592 - Users should have view permissions in order to see ADs and related data - Permissions are now required to view AD data
* Feature #581 - Factors should have a "scope" attribute - Factors can now be restricted to a single project, or single AD. Existing Factors will be updated according to current assignments.
* Feature #594 - Users automatically added to watch list on creation, assignment or comments

  # Issue #1
  # [timothy.high@gmail.com] 
  # There is a problem in development mode with classes reloading / not reloading
  # It shows up as errors in the web page such as:
  #   Project(#51730400) expected, got Project(#50128210)
  # For more information, see http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8246

  A number of solutions are recommended in the ticket above. Of all the ones recommended (there are several changes to environment.rb), the only one
  that worked was to patch association_proxy.rb. For more info, see:
  http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/d2adc451ff0236c2/b95a3bc9cb97f988?#b95a3bc9cb97f988
  
  UPDATE: Unfortunately, this hasn't solved the problem in all cases. It seems that not only have the exact class representation changed, but whole
  methods have gone missing from the newly loaded versions! The only workaround left for me has been to run my local server in production mode.
  
  ################################
  # Issue #2
  # [timothy.high@gmail.com] 
  # Currently, when reordering priorities via drag and drop,
  # If you drag the link itself (rather than the row), it activates the link,
  # and opens up the "show" Arch Decision page, rather than performing a reordering
