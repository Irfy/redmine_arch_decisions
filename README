OVERVIEW

The purpose of the Arch Decision plugin for Redmine is to allow teams to collaborate on project decisions (primarily technical ones), 
to encourage explicit statements of assumptions and prioritizations, and to provide tracking after the decision has been made so that
teams can have a collective memory as to how decisions were made in the past.

VERSION: 0.0.3

RELEASE NOTES
*IMPORTANT NOTICE* If you've previously installed Arch Decisions 0.1, you may have to start over (or manually update the database). There were some 
changes made to the pre-existing migration scripts. All future changes will be incremental, but these were fundamental enough that I wanted to
start over.

* Added project menus
* Arch Decisions now an optional project module
* ADs now linked to a specific project
* Added easy form tabbing
* Users now associated with factors and ADs via "created_by" and "assigned_to" (although not yet visible on the screens)
* You can now drag/drop Factors on the AD screen to reorder their priorities
* The Arch Decision show page offers the hotkey shortcuts 'n' and 'f' (for New Factor) and 'a' (for Add Factor)
* ADs and Factors now have statuses (but no explicit workflow)

CURRENT FEATURES

* List Arch Decisions (currently only manually, via the /arch_decisions URL)
* List Factors (currently only manually, via the /factors URL)
* CRUD Arch Decisions (with only basic info)
* CRUD Factors (with only basic info)
* Associate Factors with ADs, and remove associations
* Reorder factor priorities for each AD

ROADMAP

* Integration with standard Redmine security
* Add a discussion forum to both ADs and Factors
* Allow configuration of notifications for these discussions and status change events
* Allow associations between ADs and Issues
* Allow tagging of ADs and Factors for easy and flexible categorization and search
* Record multiple "strategies" for each AD to track the different approaches considered, and highlight the one that was selected in the end

KNOWN ISSUES

  ################################
  # Issue #1
  # [timothy.high@gmail.com] 
  # There is a problem in development mode with classes reloading / not reloading
  # It shows up as errors in the web page such as:
  #   Project(#51730400) expected, got Project(#50128210)
  # For more information, see http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8246
  ################################
  
  A number of solutions are recommended in the ticket above. Of all the ones recommended (there are several changes to environment.rb), the only one
  that worked was to patch association_proxy.rb. For more info, see:
  http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/d2adc451ff0236c2/b95a3bc9cb97f988?#b95a3bc9cb97f988
  
  ################################
  # Issue #2
  # [timothy.high@gmail.com] 
  # Currently, when reordering priorities via drag and drop,
  # If you drag the link itself (rather than the row), it activates the link,
  # and opens up the "show" Arch Decision page, rather than performing a reordering
