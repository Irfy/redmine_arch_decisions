OVERVIEW

The purpose of the Arch Decision plugin for Redmine is to allow teams to collaborate on project decisions (primarily technical ones), 
to encourage explicit statements of assumptions and prioritizations, and to provide tracking after the decision has been made so that
teams can have a collective memory as to how decisions were made in the past.

VERSION: 0.0.6

RELEASE NOTES

* Feature #583 - Implement notification features for ADs, etc. - Notifications are sent when AD, Factor, Strategy or Discussion is created or updated
* Feature #587 - Show the number of comments for each Factor and Strategy on the main AD view
* Bug #586 - Discussions created in Strategies also show up in the AD - Solution includes a migration script to fix existing discussions
* Added unit tests for all models and some controllers 

CURRENT FEATURES

* List Arch Decisions (currently only manually, via the /arch_decisions URL)
* List Factors (currently only manually, via the /factors URL)
* CRUD Arch Decisions (with only basic info)
* CRUD Factors (with only basic info)
* Associate Factors with ADs, and remove associations
* Reorder factor priorities for each AD
* List and CRUD Arch Decision Strategies
* Arch Decisions, Factors and Strategies each have their own Discussion section

ROADMAP

* Add a "scope" attribute to Factors so they can apply to the project, be universal, or apply only to the AD in which they were created
* Integration with standard Redmine security
* Allow associations between ADs and Issues
* Allow tagging of ADs and Factors for easy and flexible categorization and search
* Enable full-fledged search across all model types

  # Issue #1
  # [timothy.high@gmail.com] 
  # There is a problem in development mode with classes reloading / not reloading
  # It shows up as errors in the web page such as:
  #   Project(#51730400) expected, got Project(#50128210)
  # For more information, see http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8246

  A number of solutions are recommended in the ticket above. Of all the ones recommended (there are several changes to environment.rb), the only one
  that worked was to patch association_proxy.rb. For more info, see:
  http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/d2adc451ff0236c2/b95a3bc9cb97f988?#b95a3bc9cb97f988
  
  UPDATE: Unfortunately, this hasn't solved the problem in all cases. It seems that not only have the exact class representation changed, but whole
  methods have gone missing from the newly loaded versions! The only workaround left for me has been to run my local server in production mode.
  
  ################################
  # Issue #2
  # [timothy.high@gmail.com] 
  # Currently, when reordering priorities via drag and drop,
  # If you drag the link itself (rather than the row), it activates the link,
  # and opens up the "show" Arch Decision page, rather than performing a reordering
